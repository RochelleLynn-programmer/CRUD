A demonstration of CRUD.

Built by Rochelle Edwards.

This app takes in a user's photo entries and stores them into a database. Once image and related content is stored, user can update the information or delete. Authentication is not implemented, so this will not get deployed. 

Please clone, install dependencies for the client and server side, and provide your own MongoDB url.

Stack includes React, MaterialUI, Node, Mongoose, GridFS, Multer, and Express.

Front end is React and styled with MaterialUI.

Back end API is written with Express, using Mongoose to connect to MongoDB database, and using GridFs to handle image uploads.
